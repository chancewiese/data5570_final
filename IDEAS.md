We can add suggestions/ideas here for improvement


1. Make it so events can be 'sub-events' or children events of other ones. 
    We can limit it so each child can only have 1 parent event, 
    and if it's a parent event, it can't have a parent event itself
2. Improve homepage looks, maybe have a box with upcoming events on the homepage.
3. Add the ability to add images or attachments to an event card or event page.
4. Implement a calendar view/page of events.
5. QR code for events/sharing pop-up from events page. 
6. Custom registration forms (this might be a big one)






Main Ideas (Drex)
`Event Calendar View`: Add a calendar that shows events by date. Users can click on a date to see what events are scheduled that day.
`Real-Time Updates`: Enable live updates for event availability using WebSockets or long polling, so users see changes instantly.
`User Authentication`: Implement user roles like attendee, organizer, and admin to manage access and functionality securely.
`Admin Panel`: Build a dashboard for admins to manage events, registrations, and users efficiently.
`Notifications`: Let users sign up for email or SMS reminders for upcoming events to keep them informed.

Other Ideas (Drex)
`Waitlist Management`: Add a feature for users to join a waitlist for fully booked events, so they can be notified if spots open up.
`Dark Mode`: Add a dark mode toggle for a more accessible and personalized user experience.
`Search and Filter`: Allow users to search for events by keywords or filter by category, date, or location for better usability.
`Social Sharing`: Include share buttons so users can promote events on their social media platforms.
`Google Maps/OpenStreetMap`: Show event locations on a map and provide directions to help users find venues easily.
